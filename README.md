# boot-wiremock
Hacked Wiremock into a Spring Boot application so that you can register mocks onto a discovery service. I've got it configured to register to Consul right now, but it's pretty straightforward to change for Eureka etc. Just do the same thing you'd do with any Spring Boot application.
